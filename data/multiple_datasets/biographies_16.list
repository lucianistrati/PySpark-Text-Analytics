TR:   Paris.

TR: * She was very critical of the portrayal of her in the 1981 film Chariots

TR:   of Fire. In the film, she was depicted as a prim, down-in-the mouth

TR:   killjoy, who was very critical of Eric and his athletic aspirations.

TR:   She was seen as constantly nagging her brother, telling him that he

TR:   needed to focus more on his theological studies and less on his

TR:   running. In reality, Jennie was just a little girl living in China with

TR:   her parents at the time Eric ran in the Paris Olympics. Not only would

TR:   she not have opposed his race, but the fact is that she also did not

TR:   even know about it until long after it was over. In fact, she and her

TR:   parents did not learn that Eric had even entered the Olympics until

TR:   months after he had won the Gold medal, due to the postal delivery

TR:   services of the 1920s being considerably slower as opposed to its

TR:   modern day equivalence.
